Hey DeepLearningAI,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm happy to help you with enabling memory for your agents and kicking off your Crew. 

Let's break down how to enable memory for your agents:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from crewai import Agent

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your OpenAI Key"

# Creating an agent with memory enabled
researcher = Agent(
    role='Senior Researcher',
    goal='Uncover groundbreaking technologies in {topic}',
    backstory=("Driven by curiosity, you're at the forefront of innovation, "
    "eager to explore and share knowledge that could change the world."),
    memory=True, # Enable memory for the agent
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    tools=[search_tool, browser_tool],
    allow_code_execution=False,
    max_iter=15,
    max_rpm=100,
    max_execution_time=3600,
    system_template="Your custom system template here",
    prompt_template="Your custom prompt template here",
    response_template="Your custom response template here",
)
```

By setting `memory=True` when creating your agent, you're enabling the agent to store and recall past conversations and actions. This allows for more contextual and coherent interactions within the Crew.

Now, to kick off your Crew, you'll need to use the `Crew` class from the `crewai` library:

```python
from crewai import Crew

# Create a Crew instance
my_crew = Crew(
    name="My Research Crew",
    agents=[researcher], # Add your agent with memory enabled
    # ... other Crew parameters
)

# Kick off the Crew
my_crew.run()
```

This code will create a Crew named "My Research Crew" with your memory-enabled researcher agent. The `.run()` method starts the Crew, allowing your agents to begin interacting with each other and completing tasks.

Let me know if you have any other questions. I'm here to help you get the most out of CrewAI!
